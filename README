Voglet is a program to practise vocabulary.

I created it primarily to get comfortable with Java and OOP.
It's main purpose is to get me some hands-on practise with development tools.
For example I would like to get proficient using git, javadoc, ant, Netbeans and other stuff.

In my job I mainly code in C, this project is just a way for me to discover other things. 

Notice:
I dont update this repo anymore. For a new version of voglet take a look at: https://github.com/jubalh/voglet-qt
